# Youtube_Harvesting_Project
First Project on Data Science Class 

# Objective
Create a Streamlit application that allows users to input YouTube channel IDs, retrieve relevant data using the Google API, and store the data for up to 10 channels in a data lake with the option to save in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. The application should also enable users to search and retrieve data from the SQL database using various search options, including table joins for detailed channel information.

# Approach

We approach the problem by analysing all the requirements clearly and draw the workflow of the application using the conditions stated in the problem statement.

**Bugs:-** still the presence of lottie animation crashes the application if the network is very slow.

**Things to do to improve:-**

1) Save all API keys in .env file.
2) Make it as a Multipage Application
3) Create ML model to analyse customer sentiment using comments and suggests better video to be posted 
4) Create ML model to analyse the growth trajectory or factors that determine the success and failure of a youtube channel like optimum interval of posting , optimum duration during the growth stage ,  content type during the process  etc

Overall , an awesome experience in learning the technology and implementing it in code.



Thank You for the Opportunity.
